## AWS
IP address: http://3.136.128.254/

To access from the console: `âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]`

## DNS
To find an IP address for any domain: `dig [domain name]`

To get information about a domain name: `whois [domain name]`

An `address` or `A` record mapgs a domain name directly to an IP address

A `canonical name` or `CNAME` maps one domain name to anotehr domain name

## HTML

### Things I learned from Simon html
`<thead>` - table header

`<th>` - columns names in the table header

`<hr />` - html design element that adds a line

`<menu>` - an input alternate to unordered lists

`readonly` - is an attribute that makes it so the user cannot input something in the text box 

#### General things I learned
When typing an `=` after attributes, VS code automatically fills in the `""` that must follow. Elements *usually* have a separate opening tag and a closing tag, however you can open and close the element with one tag when the element only includes attributes and you don't want text inside the element. Ex: `<path insert-attributes here/>`.
